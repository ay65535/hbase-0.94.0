<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.rootdir</name>
    <value>file://${user.home}/hbase-${user.name}/tables</value>
    <description>The directory shared by region servers and into
    which HBase persists.  The URL should be 'fully-qualified'
    to include the filesystem scheme.  For example, to specify the
    HDFS directory '/hbase' where the HDFS instance's namenode is
    running at namenode.example.org on port 9000, set this value to:
    hdfs://namenode.example.org:9000/hbase.  By default HBase writes
    into /tmp.  Change this configuration else all data will be lost
    on machine restart.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.cluster.distributed</name>
    <value>false</value>
    <description>The mode the cluster will be in. Possible values are
      false for standalone mode and true for distributed mode.  If
      false, startup will run all HBase and ZooKeeper daemons together
      in the one JVM.
    </description>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>hbase.tmp.dir</name>
    <value>${user.home}/hbase-${user.name}/tmp</value>
    <description>Temporary directory on the local filesystem.
    Change this setting to point to a location more permanent
    than '/tmp' (The '/tmp' directory is often cleared on
    machine restart).

  The following three properties are used together to create the list of
  host:peer_port:leader_port quorum servers for ZooKeeper.
  -->
  <property>
  	<name>hbase.zookeeper.quorum</name>
  	<value>localhost</value>
  	<description>Comma separated list of servers in the ZooKeeper Quorum.
  	For example, "host1.mydomain.com,host2.mydomain.com,host3.mydomain.com".
  	By default this is set to localhost for local and pseudo-distributed modes
  	of operation. For a fully-distributed setup, this should be set to a full
  	list of ZooKeeper quorum servers. If HBASE_MANAGES_ZK is set in hbase-env.sh
  	this is the list of servers which we will start/stop ZooKeeper on.

  <!--
  Beginning of properties that are directly mapped from ZooKeeper's zoo.cfg.
  All properties with an "hbase.zookeeper.property." prefix are converted for
  ZooKeeper's configuration. Hence, if you want to add an option from zoo.cfg,
  e.g.  "initLimit=10" you would append the following to your configuration:
    <property>
      <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.initLimit</name>
      <value>10</value>
    </property>
  -->
  <property>
    <name>hbase.zookeeper.property.dataDir</name>
    <value>${hbase.tmp.dir}/zookeeper</value>
    <description>Property from ZooKeeper's config zoo.cfg.
    The directory where the snapshot is stored.
